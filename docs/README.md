# What is Brotocol?

Brotocol Bridge is a MPC-based hybrid bi-directional bridge that acts as a 'connector' between Bitcoin and other blockchains, enabling seamless asset transfers and swaps between Bitcoin and its Layer 2 networks (L2s) as well as other blockchain ecosystems.&#x20;

**Brotocol currently offers two key features:**

* [BroBridge](features/broswap/)
* [BroSwap](features/broswap/)

## Key Features

* **Bi-Directional Asset Transfers**: Easily transfer assets between Bitcoin and L2s, as well as non-Bitcoin chains.
* **Secure and Decentralized**: Utilizes multisigs and decentralized validators to secure all transfers.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to provide a smooth experience for both novice and experienced users.
* **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Supports multiple blockchains including Bitcoin, Stacks, and EVM-compatible chains.

Brotocol plays a crucial role in projects building on Bitcoin, offering a 'native-like' DeFi experience by enabling users to interact with smart contracts on L2s using native BTC or other Bitcoin L1 assets.
