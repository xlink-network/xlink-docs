### What is Brotocol?

Brotocol [BroBridge](../features/brobridge/) is a **MPC-based hybrid bi-directional bridge** that acts as a '**connector**' between Bitcoin and other blockchains, enabling anyone to move between chains beyond the limitation of just EVM-based bridges.

### Why Brotocol?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Bridging shouldnâ€™t suckâ€”high fees and sketchy paths are out. Brotocolâ€™s your **crypto bro**, offering:

* **Lowest Fees:** Just **0.1%** to bridge native Bitcoin to EVM chains.
* **Most Bridge Paths:** Supports **18+ networks**, including non-EVM.
* **Rock-Solid Security:** MPC-based for stress-free transfers.
* **Seamless Swaps Across Chains:** Allowing users to swap to any assets from native Bitcoin to EVM tokens back and forth.

### Brotocolâ€™s Rate is Unbeatable!

If you are bridging 1 $BTCâ€”how much do you keep, letâ€™s see the table below:

_**ðŸ”´:** No direct bridge but requires the use of CEX deposit/withdrawal and does not include withdrawal fees_

Beyond the savings, Brotocol has the most BTC-friendly route possible!

### How does Brotocol Work?

When you want to move assets (like Bitcoin) from one network to another, Brotocol handles the process, making sure everything happens securely.

**Hereâ€™s how it work:**

* You start by deciding how much you want to bridge on our UI (e.g: Native $BTC â†’ Arbâ€™s $WBTC)
* We lock that amount in a multisig wallet.
* Once network confirmed, our validators unlock the equivalent on your target chain (e.g., $WBTC on Arbitrum).
* Doneâ€”You pay 0.1% fee once.

### Brotocol by the Numbers!

### Bridge Challenges Today

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/6.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Limited Network Support:** Most centralized exchanges (CEXs) donâ€™t support depositing $WBTC on Arbitrum or other low-TVL EVM chains, reducing liquidity and options.
* **High and Unpredictable Costs:** Moving $BTC across EVM and non-EVM chains is expensive and inconsistent due to fees (bridging, swapping, withdrawals) and liquidity issues.
* **Complex CEX Workarounds:** Users must either bridge Arbitrumâ€™s $WBTC to Ethereumâ€™s $WBTC and deposit/withdraw via CEX, or swap to $ETH, deposit, trade, and withdrawâ€”both costly and often requiring KYC.
* **Lack of Bridge Options:** Popular bridges (e.g., Wormhole, Stargate) rarely offer consistent paths between chains like Arbitrum, BNB, or Ethereum for $BTC variants.
* **Poor User Experience:** Different $BTC versions vary in support, cost, and ease of movement, creating a confusing and inefficient onboarding process that limits chain adoption.

Letâ€™s take Arbitrumâ€™s $WBTC as a quick example.

Arbitrumâ€™s $WBTC moves **$1.3B/month** on Uniswap and holds **$243M** in Aave deposits (March 25, 2025). Bridging it to native BTC? A messâ€”until Brotocol:

* **Old Way:** CEX swaps, high fees, or no paths.
* **Brotocol Way:** 0.1% fee, direct to BTC, 18+ chain options.

Demand for EVM BTC is hugeâ€”Brotocol makes it flow.
